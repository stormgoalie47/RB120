# Which of the following are objects in Ruby? If they are objects, 
# how can you find out what class they belong to?

# true                                  #object
# "hello"                               #object
# [1, 2, 3, "happy days"]               #object
# 142                                   #object

# can determine class by calling `class` method on each object
