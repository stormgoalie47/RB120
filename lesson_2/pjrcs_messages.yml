welcome: "Welcome to Python, JavaScript, Ruby, C++, Swift (PJRCS)!"

detail:  " This is a variation of rock paper scissors, where you will\n
          choose from one of five programming languages and the computer\n
          will chooose one too. See the rules below:\n\n"

computer_info: "A random computer will be selected. Some computers have odd personalites\n
                \tand will only choose certain programming languages."

personalities: " Steve Jobs will only choose Swift.\n
                Bjarne Stroustrup just does not like Ruby...\n
                Dennis Ritchie will never choose what you do because he can read your mind.\n
                \tmind, but doesn't remember what moves win (so it's not really cheating).\n
                Yukihiro Matsumoto will use any language.\n\n"

rules: " Python erases Javascript and C++.\n
        JavaScript empties Ruby and Swift core libraries.\n
        Ruby pops off C++ and Python.\n
        C++ deconstructs Swift and JavaScript.\n
        Swift scrambles Python and Ruby code.\n\n\n"

Steve Jobs: "Steve Jobs will only choose Swift.\n\n"

Bjarne Stroustrup: "Bjarne Stroustrup just does not like Ruby...\n\n"

Dennis Ritchie: "Dennis Ritchie will never choose what you do because he can read\n
                \tyour mind, but doesn't remember what moves win...\n\n"

Yukihiro Matsumoto: "Yukihiro Matsumoto will use any language.\n\n"
